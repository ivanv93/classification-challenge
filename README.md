# Classification-Challenge

## Introduction

This project is aimed at building a spam detector using machine learning models. The objective is to classify email messages as spam or not using two different models: Logistic Regression and Random Forests Classifier. I was provided assistance by Sean Morey, the instructor of the class. Angel Milla, a BCS tutor, was a big help. I lastly could not have been able to finish this code without the help from the BCS Xpert Learning Assistant.

## Project Structure

    1. Data Retrieval: Imported the dataset using Pandas and displayed the data.

    2. Model Prediction: Predicted which model might perform better and justified the prediction.

    3. Data Preprocessing:
        * Split the data into training and testing sets.
        * Scaled the data for better model performance.

    4. Model Training: Created and trained two models: Logistic Regression and Random Forests Classifier.

    5. Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the models using accuracy scores.

    6. Results: Displayed and interpreted the results.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of building and evaluating a spam detector using two different machine learning models. By comparing their performance, I determined Random Forest Classifier was the more effective model based on their accuracy scores.
